<ul id='faqs'>
	<li>
		<h3>Can I buy over the phone with a credit card?</h3>
		<p>Yes, there is no order minimum and you don't have to have an account.  While we normally work with larger account customers, you can still order a small part one time over the phone or over the site and you can pay with your credit card.  Call 800-390-3299 to speak with an electrical supply expert.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Can I open an account and send a PO?</h3>
		<p>Of course, fill out our <a href=''>credit application</a>. Fax that back to us with a copy of your PO.  Accounts typically take 24-48 hours to open.  You will be contacted with 48 hours with an update on your account standing.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>I don't see the item I need on your website, why?</h3>
		<p>We have about half a million parts listed, we have lots of them in stock and the parts we don't carry can be ordered and shipped &ndash; quickly.  If you aren't seeing your part listed, call in and speak to an electrical supply expert 800-390-3299.  We have inventory that's not currently listed online.</p>

		<h3>What is Certified Green?</h3>
		<p>These days it seems everyone is going green and LiveWire is no exception. You should go green with us. For starters, we will proudly contribute 3% of the proceeds from this sale to benefit the <a href='http://www.edf.org/home.cfm'>Environmental Defense Fund</a>.<br /><br />This product has been Certified Green because it may have previously been in service. Most of our Certified Green Breakers were removed from service by professional electricians and require no reconditioning. They are tested and cleaned to look and function good as new. In fact, they carry the same 1-year warranty as our new breakers. When possible, LiveWire will ship this breaker from a regional warehouse close to you to cut down on total emissions associated with shipping. Basically, we hope you buy this green breaker to cut down on the waste associated with the production of new equipment that does the same thing.</p>

		<h3>Your price seems really low; is it really, really new?</h3>
		<p><strong>Yes, this item is NEW!</strong><br /> Most Distributors are locked in at a set price based on regional-price restrictions set by manufactures. LiveWire Supply is a National Supplier with customers from San Francisco, CA to Syracuse, NY so we are allowed to set our own prices. We buy new product in bulk and are able to negotiate pricing significantly lower than most other companies. In fact, some of our inventory comes right from our customers. Click Sell to LiveWire if you have bulk inventory.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Are you an authorized distributor?</h3>
		<p>We are an authorized distributor for several lines; we are also a surplus supplier for dozens of lines as well.  To check our current authorized status call 800-390-3299.  We are adding new lines every month.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>From where does my order ship?</h3>
		<p>We have regional stocking locations across the country.  The most common items are stocked in multiple locations and might only take a couple of days to reach their destination.  Larger shipping locations include: CA, TX, OH, NY, CO, MI, WA, OR, TN, GA.  If you need a part next day, it is best to call 800-390-3299 and speak to an electrical supply expert and let them know about your urgent need.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Can you ship on weekends?</h3>
		<p>Yes, we can ship on weekends.  Call 800-390-3299 and speak with an electrical supply expert.  Shipping fees on weekends are very high, however.  There is typically a $500 minimum fee for same-day shipping on the weekend.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>How do I return a part?</h3>
		<p>A return authorization must be obtained from the LiveWire Online Customer Service Center or from a member of the LiveWire Electrical Supply Inc. sales team or management group. Visit livewiresupply.com/customersupport to apply for a return authorization number. Restocking fees may be assessed to all returns not qualifying for a refund and when a customer does not request a replacement. While the specific restocking fee is left to the seller's discretion, all items returned are subject to a restocking fee of up to 100%. Shipper is not responsible for equipment damaged in transit.</p>
