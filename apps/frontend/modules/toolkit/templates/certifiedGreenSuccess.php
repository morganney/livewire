<h2 class='going_grn'>SHOULD I GO GREEN? <strong>YES!</strong></h2>
<p>These days it seems everyone is going green and LiveWire is no exception. You should go green with us. For starters, we will proudly contribute <strong>3% of the proceeds from this sale to benefit the <a href='http://www.edf.org/home.cfm'>Environmental Defense Fund</a></strong>.</p>
<p>This product has been Certified Green because it may have previously been in service. Most of our Certified Green Breakers were removed from service by professional electricians and require no reconditioning. They are tested and cleaned to look and function good as new. In fact, they carry the <strong>same 1-year warranty as our new breakers</strong>. When possible, LiveWire will ship this breaker from a regional warehouse close to you to cut down on total emissions associated with shipping. Basically, we hope you buy this green breaker to cut down on the waste associated with the production of new equipment that does the same thing.</p>
