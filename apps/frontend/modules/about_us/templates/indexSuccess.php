In October 2008 and again in 2009, the State of California honored Adam and LiveWire's efforts with a highly coveted &quot;Best of California Waste Reduction&quot; award. Other winners include Apple Inc., Chevron, Anheuser-Busch Inc., Chevron, Coca-Cola Inc. and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E).</p>
